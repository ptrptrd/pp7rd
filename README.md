👋 Hi, I’m @pp7rd

I am currently exploring the world of testing - from the unit test until e2e scenarios. 
Apart from that I am generally curious in trying many things out, therefore mixed kinds of repositories.

<!---
pp7rd/pp7rd is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
